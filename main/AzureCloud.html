    </li>
    <li>What is a Docker container?
        <div class="answer">A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.</div>
    </li>
    <li>How do you create a Dockerfile for a Java microservice?
        <div class="answer">
        <p>A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Here is an example Dockerfile for a Java microservice:</p>
        <pre><code>
    # Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
    FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the JAR file into the container
    COPY target/my-microservice.jar /app/my-microservice.jar

    # Expose the port the application runs on
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Run the JAR file
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "my-microservice.jar"]
        </code></pre>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>How do you build a Docker image for a Java microservice?
        <div class="answer">

        <div class="answer">
        <p>Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Here is an example docker-compose.yml file for managing multiple Java microservices:</p>
        <pre><code>
    version: '3'
    services:
      service1:
    image: my-microservice1:latest
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
      service2:
    image: my-microservice2:latest
    ports:
      - "8082:8080"
        </code></pre>

        </li>
        <li>How do you use the @Cacheable annotation with Redis?
            <div class="answer">The @Cacheable annotation is used to cache the result of a method in Redis. When the method is called, the result is stored in the cache, and subsequent calls with the same parameters return the cached result. For example:
                <pre><code>@Service
public class MyService {
    @Cacheable(value = "myCache", key = "#id")
    public MyObject getMyObjectById(String id) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you use the @CachePut annotation with Redis?
            <div class="answer">The @CachePut annotation is used to update the cache with the result of a method. It ensures that the cache is updated with the latest data. For example:
                <pre><code>@Service
public class MyService {
    @CachePut(value = "myCache", key = "#id")
    public MyObject updateMyObject(String id, MyObject myObject) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you use the @CacheEvict annotation with Redis?
            <div class="answer">The @CacheEvict annotation is used to remove an entry from the cache. It ensures that the cache is cleared when the annotated method is called. For example:
                <pre><code>@Service
public class MyService {
    @CacheEvict(value = "myCache", key = "#id")
    public void deleteMyObject(String id) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you configure Redis in a Spring Boot application?
            <div class="answer">To configure Redis in a Spring Boot application, add the following properties to your application.properties file:
                <pre><code>spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Example of using RedisTemplate in a Spring Boot application:
            <div class="answer">
                <pre><code>@Service
public class RedisService {
    private final RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public RedisService(RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate) {
        this.redisTemplate = redisTemplate;
    }

    public void save(String key, Object value) {
        redisTemplate.opsForValue().set(key, value);
    }

    public Object get(String key) {
        return redisTemplate.opsForValue().get(key);
    }

    public void delete(String key) {
        redisTemplate.delete(key);
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>

        </li>
        <li>How do you update a deployment in AKS?
            <div class="answer">To update a deployment in AKS, you can modify the deployment YAML file and apply the changes using kubectl apply. For example:
                <pre><code>kubectl apply -f updated-deployment.yaml</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you roll back a deployment in AKS?
            <div class="answer">You can roll back a deployment in AKS using the kubectl rollout undo command. For example, to roll back the last deployment of my-deployment, run:
                <pre><code>kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deployment</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you expose a deployment in AKS?
            <div class="answer">You can expose a deployment in AKS by creating a Kubernetes service. For example, to expose a deployment named my-deployment as a LoadBalancer service, create a service YAML file and apply it using kubectl:
                <pre><code>kubectl apply -f service.yaml</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you manage secrets in AKS?
            <div class="answer">You can manage secrets in AKS using Kubernetes Secrets. Create a secret using kubectl create secret and reference it in your deployment YAML file. For example:
                <pre><code>kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=username=myuser --from-literal=password=mypassword</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
