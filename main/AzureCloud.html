        <div class="answer">Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable, and run consistently across different environments.</div>
    </li>
    <li>What is a Docker container?
        <div class="answer">A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.</div>
    </li>
    <li>How do you create a Dockerfile for a Java microservice?
        <div class="answer">
        <p>A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Here is an example Dockerfile for a Java microservice:</p>
        <pre><code>
    # Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
    FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the JAR file into the container
    COPY target/my-microservice.jar /app/my-microservice.jar

    # Expose the port the application runs on
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Run the JAR file
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "my-microservice.jar"]
        </code></pre>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>How do you build a Docker image for a Java microservice?
        <div class="answer">
        <p>To build a Docker image for a Java microservice, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>docker build -t my-microservice:latest .</code></pre>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>How do you run a Docker container for a Java microservice?
        <div class="answer">

    </li>
    <li>How do you use Docker Compose to manage multiple Java microservices?
        <div class="answer">
        <p>Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Here is an example docker-compose.yml file for managing multiple Java microservices:</p>
        <pre><code>
    version: '3'
    services:
      service1:
    image: my-microservice1:latest
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
      service2:
    image: my-microservice2:latest
    ports:
      - "8082:8080"
        </code></pre>

        </li>
        <li>How do you use the @Cacheable annotation with Redis?
            <div class="answer">The @Cacheable annotation is used to cache the result of a method in Redis. When the method is called, the result is stored in the cache, and subsequent calls with the same parameters return the cached result. For example:
                <pre><code>@Service
public class MyService {
    @Cacheable(value = "myCache", key = "#id")
    public MyObject getMyObjectById(String id) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you use the @CachePut annotation with Redis?
            <div class="answer">The @CachePut annotation is used to update the cache with the result of a method. It ensures that the cache is updated with the latest data. For example:
                <pre><code>@Service
public class MyService {
    @CachePut(value = "myCache", key = "#id")
    public MyObject updateMyObject(String id, MyObject myObject) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you use the @CacheEvict annotation with Redis?
            <div class="answer">The @CacheEvict annotation is used to remove an entry from the cache. It ensures that the cache is cleared when the annotated method is called. For example:
                <pre><code>@Service
public class MyService {
    @CacheEvict(value = "myCache", key = "#id")
    public void deleteMyObject(String id) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you configure Redis in a Spring Boot application?
            <div class="answer">To configure Redis in a Spring Boot application, add the following properties to your application.properties file:
                <pre><code>spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Example of using RedisTemplate in a Spring Boot application:
            <div class="answer">
                <pre><code>@Service
public class RedisService {
    private final RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public RedisService(RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate) {
        this.redisTemplate = redisTemplate;
    }

    public void save(String key, Object value) {
        redisTemplate.opsForValue().set(key, value);
    }

    public Object get(String key) {
        return redisTemplate.opsForValue().get(key);
    }

    public void delete(String key) {
        redisTemplate.delete(key);
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>

        <li>How do you monitor an AKS cluster?
            <div class="answer">You can monitor an AKS cluster using Azure Monitor for containers, which provides insights into the performance and health of your cluster. You can also use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for more advanced monitoring and visualization.</div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you update a deployment in AKS?
            <div class="answer">To update a deployment in AKS, you can modify the deployment YAML file and apply the changes using kubectl apply. For example:
                <pre><code>kubectl apply -f updated-deployment.yaml</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you roll back a deployment in AKS?
            <div class="answer">You can roll back a deployment in AKS using the kubectl rollout undo command. For example, to roll back the last deployment of my-deployment, run:
                <pre><code>kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deployment</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you expose a deployment in AKS?
            <div class="answer">You can expose a deployment in AKS by creating a Kubernetes service. For example, to expose a deployment named my-deployment as a LoadBalancer service, create a service YAML file and apply it using kubectl:
                <pre><code>kubectl apply -f service.yaml</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>How do you manage secrets in AKS?
            <div class="answer">You can manage secrets in AKS using Kubernetes Secrets. Create a secret using kubectl create secret and reference it in your deployment YAML file. For example:
                <pre><code>kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=username=myuser --from-literal=password=mypassword</code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
